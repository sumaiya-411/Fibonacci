# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This Python script generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`th term using an iterative approach.

## How It Works

- The script initializes the sequence with the first two Fibonacci numbers: `[0, 1]`.
- It then uses a `for` loop to calculate and append the next numbers in the sequence.
- The resulting list is returned and printed.

## Example

```python
print(fibonacci(10))
